I am proud of actually being able to produce a good code. All though I did get a decent amount of help from people to clarify certain things (such as like how to move the actual shape 
in the code, I still in the end used my skills and knowledge to build a code. With that being said, I still have some trouble putting together certain aspects of the code or just how to 
do them in general, but my skills have definetley improved. Furthermore, the more I practice the better I will get at it.
