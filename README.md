# persistence-and-movement

Call to random: the random function is put in place in order to generatw a random value, for this code specifically it is used ti generate a random value for the blue chanel of the ellipses color 

Variable to track change over time: This is incremented over time to control the movement of the elipses

Variable to store and intermediate: the movmernt variable holds the sine value to determine how much the elipse moves horrizontally 

combination of variables: the variables x (horizontal) and b (blue color) are updated dynamically using calculations based off of time and randomization
